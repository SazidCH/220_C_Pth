Discard Cards:
You and your friends are playing a card game. You pick n numbers of UNO cards from the deck. The rule of the card game is- one person says a number, t and you have to discard the alternative cards with the same number from your hand without changing the relative position of other cards. Implement the scenario using a proper method which takes the cards in your hands as an array and a number as parameters; and returns the resulting array. The empty spaces are denoted as 0 in the array.
Start from deleting the first t.
Sample Input / Driver Code:
cards=[1,3,7,2,5,2,2,2,0]

#Function Call: 
print(discardCards(cards, t = 2))

Sample Output:
[1,3,7,5,2,2,0,0,0]

Explanation:
[1,3,7,20,5,21,22,23,0]
Starting from the first 2, the alternative 2’s are 20 and 22. After removing them, the resulting array is - [1,3,7,5,2,2,0,0,0]



Sample Input / Driver Code:
cards=[5,5,5,0,0]

#Function Call: 
print(discardCards(cards, t = 5))

Sample Output:
[5,0,0,0,0]

Explanation:
[50, 51, 52,0,0]
Starting from the first 5, the alternative 5’s are 50 and 52. After removing them, the resulting array is -
[5,0,0,0,0]
