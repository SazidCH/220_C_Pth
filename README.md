To change the license of your repository on GitHub, follow these steps:

1. **Decide on the License**:
   Choose the appropriate license based on your project's goals. Common options include MIT, Apache 2.0, and GPL.

2. **Add or Update the License File**:
   - If a license file already exists (`LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt`), edit it with the new license text.
   - If not, create a new file named `LICENSE` in the repository root and paste the license text.

3. **Commit the Changes**:
   - Stage the changes:
     ```bash
     git add LICENSE
     ```
   - Commit with a message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Updated license to [license name]"
     ```
   - Push the changes:
     ```bash
     git push
     ```

4. **Update Documentation**:
   Ensure the README and other relevant files reflect the license change.

5. **Inform Contributors** (if needed):
   Notify collaborators about the change, especially if contributions are governed by the license.
