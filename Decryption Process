Decryption Process:
	Suppose you're working as a cryptographer for a secret intelligence agency. You	 are given an encrypted matrix as an input. You have to decrypt it after some processing of the given matrix.

To decrypt this message efficiently, you have a task to construct a method called decrypt_matrix(matrix) which takes an encrypted matrix as input and returns a decrypted linear array. The process of finding the decrypted linear array is given below:

You have to find out the column-wise summations for each column and store the difference of subsequent column-wise summations in a new linear array.
